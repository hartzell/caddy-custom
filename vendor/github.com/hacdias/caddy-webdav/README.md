Caddy plugin that implements WebDAV. You can download this plugin with Caddy on its [official download page](https://caddyserver.com/download).

## Syntax

```
webdav [url] {
    scope       path
    modify      [true|false]
    allow       path
    allow_r     regex
    block       path
    block_r     regex
}
```

All the options are optional.

+ **url** is the place where you can access the WebDAV interface. Defaults to `/`.
+ **scope** is an absolute or relative (to the current working directory of Caddy) path that indicates the scope of the WebDAV. Defaults to `.`.
+ **modify** indicates if the user has permission to edit/modify the files. Defaults to `true`.
+ **allow** and **block** are used to allow or deny access to specific files or directories using their relative path to the scope. You can use the magic word `dotfiles` to allow or deny the access to every file starting by a dot.
+ **allow_r** and **block_r** and variations of the previous options but you are able to use regular expressions with them.

It is highly recommended to use this directive alongside with [`basicauth`](https://caddyserver.com/docs/basicauth) to protect the WebDAV interface.

```
webdav {
    # You set the global configurations here and
    # all the users will inherit them.
    user1:
    # Here you can set specific settings for the 'user1'.
    # They will override the global ones for this specific user.
}
```

## Examples

WebDAV on `/` for the current working directory:

```
webdav
```

WebDAV on `/admin` for the whole file system:

```
webdav /admin {
    scope /
}
```

WebDAV on `/` for the whole file system, without access to `/etc` and `/dev` directories:

```
webdav {
    scope /
    block /etc
    block /dev
}
```

WebDAV on `/` for the whole file system. The user `sam` can't access `/var/www` but the others can.

```
basicauth / sam pass
webdav {
    scope /
    
    sam:
    block /var/www
}
```
